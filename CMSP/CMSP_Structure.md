# Structure of the Complete and Mature Software Project
Version 1.

## Introduction

The structure of the Complete Mature Software Project (CMSP) is presented according to SLMHM/SPEM. According to 17 UN goals and research of development and evolution models (see the references section below) the following facts are considered:
- Society, economy, and natural environment shall be considered;
- ISP relates to connectivity, human feelings, emotions, and morale. All ethical problems are being solved in this pattern;
- Humanizm is extended up to neohumanizm. Neohumanizm threats human related and non-human related phenomena with equal significance (non-human related phenomena include other life forms, nature, and so on);
- SLMHM and SPEM are fractal models. It means that every part of the model can be modeled by full model patterns and levels.


SPEM contains 4 patterns (sections):
- Section PSP (Primary Society Pattern). Represents the structure of the project. The highest value is the implementation of the project. It is the level where problem-solving is the highest priority;
- Section ASP (Adaptable Society Pattern). Represents benefits gained from the project implementation. The highest value is the innovations and adaptation to the changes. It is the level where human-centric approaches are the highest priority;
- Section ISP (Information Society Pattern). Represents connectivity between all relevant parties. The highest value is synergy and extraordinary innovations. It is the level where neohumanistic approaches are the highest priority;
- Section CSP (Creative Society Pattern). Represents creativity. The highest value is the total penetration into all spheres of human life. It is the level where expansion is the highest priority;
- SLMHM and SPEM are fractal models. It means that a part of the model can be modeled by the whole model.

SLMHM model contains 16 levels. The levels are distributed by 4 SPEM patterns.


## Section PSP

### 1.1. Task Statement (Desire)
**Requirements**: Full understanding of the project goals and their clear formulation.

**To do**: Clearly formulate the project goals.

### 1.2. Executants (Intention)
**Requirements**: Designation of the executants. Statement of the Intention.

**To do**: Clearly state the executants and their roles. Formulate the Statement of Intention for each executant.

### 1.3. Feasibility
**Requirements**: Means and resources needed to implement the project.

**To do**: Provide the means and resources needed to implement the project.

### 1.4. Action
**Requirements**: Actions on project development and implementation.

**To do**: Perform the project development and implementation.

## Section ASP

### 2.1. Evaluation
**Requirements**: Determination and formulation of KPI and means to their evaluation. Evaluation of the KPI.

**To do**: Provide evaluation of the KPI.

### 2.2. Improvement
**Requirements**: Continuous improvements according to evaluated KPI.

**To do**: Provide continuous improvements according to evaluated KPI.

### 2.3. Alternatives
**Requirements**: Considering the alternatives.

**To do**: Provide consideration of the alternatives.

### 2.4. Innovations
**Requirements**: Determination of whether a solution is an innovation or not.

**To do**: Formulate criteria for determining whether a solution is an innovation or not. Monitor the solution regularly to determine whether it is an innovation or not.

## Section ISP

### 3.1. Reward
**Requirements**: All relevant parties shall get the reward from the solution (Influence on the society, economy, and natural environment shall be considered).

**To do**: Determinate all relevant parties. Evaluate individual benefits and losses for all parties.

### 3.2. Optimization
**Requirements**: Increasing benefits and reducing all individual losses for all parties.

**To do**: Increase benefits and reduce all losses for all parties.

### 3.3. Synergy
**Requirements**: Total benefit for all parties is greater than the sum of individual benefits for the parties. The total loss for all parties is less than the sum of individual losses for the parties.

**To do**: Monitor and determine the achievement of synergy.

### 3.4. Extraordinary.
**Requirements**: Determination of whether a solution is an innovation for all parties or not.

**To do**: Formulate criteria for determining whether a solution is an innovation for all parties or not. Monitor the solution regularly to determine whether it is an innovation for all parties or not.

## Section CSP

### 4.1. Information
**Requirements**: Generation of new information as a result of the solution implementation.

**To do**: Implement the generation of information as a result of the solution implementation.

### 4.2. Streamlining
**Requirements**: Extraction of knowledge from the generated information (see level 4.1.).
